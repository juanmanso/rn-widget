# Sandbox app to research about Native Mobile Widgets with React Native

## 👋 Introduction

The goal of this app is to spike and test how the development of widgets is using the React Native framework.

## 🎨 Version tested in this branch

Based on the tutorial shared on the [ASAP Developers page](https://www.asapdevelopers.com/how-to-build-widgets-for-a-react-native-app/).

## 🏃 How to run the app

1. **Run `yarn install`**

This will install both runtime project dependencies and developer tools listed in `package.json`

2. [Optional] **Run `yarn start`**

Starts the Metro bundler server that loads the app on our devices for development (both virtual and physical devices)

3. **Run `yarn ios` and/or `yarn android`**

It builds the app iOS and Android respectively. If no physical devices are bound, emulators or simulators are opened to do so. Also, if the development server was not already running, it starts it on a new terminal window.
